While many management tools exist, they cannot intercommunicate and no framework is available for integrating all of them, preventing integrated water resources management to be fully achieved. WatERP will develop a web-based Open Management Platform (OMP), integrating intelligent systems through open interfaces, to enable water supply distribution chains to be managed in a unified and customized way. The OMP will provide inferred information on water supplies, flows, consumption, distribution efficiency, and supply and demand within a single framework. It comprises 3 tools: (a) Data Warehouse, using semantics and common language, (b) DSS, for coordinating actions, prioritizing water uses, improving distribution efficiency, and saving water, energy and costs, and (c) Demand Management, supporting socio-economical analyses and policies. Open standards will be used to maximize interoperability and data sharing. WatERP technologies will be developed under a user-centred participatory design.9 Partners (ES, DE, GR and UK, with a large SME component, a water authority, a water utility and a big water sector companies association) will validate the project outcomes in 2 different pilots: (1) Ter-Llobregat water supply system (ES) representing water-stressed parts of Europe and (2) Karlsruhe water supply system (DE) representing more water-rich regions. WatERP enables improved matching of water supply and demand from a holistic point of view, pursuing 2 objectives: (i) improving coordination among actors and (ii) fostering behavioural change to reduce water (8%) and energy (5%) consumption. By enabling a more dynamic and agile interaction among the different actors involved in water supply distribution, the platform improves water governance while maintaining the autonomy and independence of the actors. WatERP will also develop a strong dissemination capability, besides an evaluation of their anticipated cost and benefits and market prospects.", "To": ["2015-09-30, closed project"], "Meta": ["<meta name=\"WT.cg_s\" content=\"FP7-ICT\">"], "Topic_s": ["ICT-2011.6.3 - ICT for efficient water resources management"], "Funding_scheme": ["CP - Collaborative project (generic)"], "Coordinated_in": ["Spain"], "Activity": ["Research Organisations", "Jose Angel Freire Astray", "Tel.: +34 650 433 277", "Fax: +34 93 580 11 02", "Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments)", "Petra D\u00f6rr-Thern", "Tel.: +49 721 16006 210", "Fax: +49 721 16006 05", "Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments)", "Michael Becker", "Tel.: +49 721 599 4000", "Fax: +49 721 599 954000", "Research Organisations", "Thomas Maier", "Tel.: +49 721 9678 140", "Fax: +49 721 9678 108", "Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments)", "Christian von Beust", "Tel.: +49 721 599 1625", "Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments)", "Carmen NAVARRO", "Tel.: +34 91 574 91 07", "Fax: +34 91 574 91 06", "Public bodies (excluding Research Organisations and Secondary or Higher Education Establishments)", "Jos\u00e9 Miguel DI\u00c9GUEZ GARC\u00cdA", "Tel.: +34 93 567 28 00", "Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments)", "Rafael S\u00e1nchez-Diezma Guijarro", "Tel.: +34934054662", "Research Organisations", "Jose Angel Freire Astray", "Tel.: +34 93 553 45 40", "Fax: +34 93 553 45 41", "Research Organisations", "GREGORIS MENTZAS", "Tel.: +302107723895", "Fax: +302107724042", "Higher or Secondary Education Establishments", "Wenyan Wu", "Tel.: +44 1785 353324"], "From": ["2012-10-01"], "Project_ID": ["318603"], "Call_for_Proposal": ["FP7-ICT-2011-8"]},

PANDORA is a three year project that will develop and evaluate new computational methods to make human-built robots Persistently Autonomous, significantly reducing the frequency of assistance requests. The key to this is an ability to recognise failure and respond to it, at all levels of abstraction and time constant.Three themes for this will be explored, working synergistically together A. DESCRIBING THE WORLD will develop new probabilistic semantic representations of the environment and the state of task execution, driven by feature based localisation and world model update from sensors, and by focus of attention mechanisms. This will detect failure of task execution and its context. B.

This will enable the robot to respond strategically to action failure(s) C. ACTING ROBUSTLY will investigate the interface between re-enforcement/imitation learning methods and robust control to make action execution indifferent to unwanted motion of target or self. Following the Deep Water Horizon oilfield disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, contractors are developing hover capable autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for subsea inspection and intervention.

Instead of being physically coupled, the modules are connected via virtual links that rely on the flow of information among them, i. e. inter-module interactions are allowed by underwater communication networks at distant and close ranges and supported by visual perception at very close range. The MORPH supra-vehicle (MSV) is thus in sharp contrast to classical monolithic vehicles or even cooperative groups of marine vehicles that operate safely away from each other. These lack the capability of mutual support and multi-sensor interaction.Without rigid links, the MSV can reconfigure itself and adapt in response to the shape of the terrain. This capability provides the foundation for efficient methods to map the underwater environment with great accuracy especially in situations that defy existing technology: namely, underwater surveys over rugged terrain and structures with full 3D complexity. This includes walls with a negative slope, where precise localization of a single vehicle is not possible.The possible applications of the MSV cover a wide range of scientific and commercial areas such as monitoring of cold water coral reefs, oil and gas pipeline inspection, or harbor and dam protection. The common characteristic of these areas is the need for operating multiple, complementary instruments at very close range to unstructured underwater terrain while accomplishing proper geo-referencing at the same time.The MORPH concept requires qualitatively new behaviors such as adaptive sensor placement for perception and navigation, as well as environmental modeling in complex environments. On site view planning will lead to a solution well beyond the operational state of the art for underwater cliff surveys and other similar missions. A final demonstration on a vertical cliff, unfeasible automatically with today's technology, will validate the efficacy of the methods developed.", "To": ["2016-01-31, closed project |"], "Meta": ["<meta name=\"WT.cg_s\" content=\"FP7-ICT\">"], "Topic_s": ["ICT-2011.2.1 - Cognitive Systems and Robotics"], "Funding_scheme": ["CP - Collaborative project (generic)"], "Coordinated_in": ["Germany"], "Activity": ["Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments)", "Lena Panek", "Tel.: +494214573897", "Fax: +494214573525", "Research Organisations", "Edoardo Bovio", "Tel.: +39 0187 527321", "Fax: +39 0187 527700", "Higher or Secondary Education Establishments", "Ronald Kieschnick", "Tel.: +49 421 200 4515", "Higher or Secondary Education Establishments", "Christoph AMENT", "Tel.: +493677692815", "Fax: +493677691434", "Higher or Secondary Education Establishments", "Jordi Casta\u00f1er", "Tel.: +34972419532", "Research Organisations", "Martine MORVAN", "Tel.: +33298224593", "Fax: +33298224366", "Research Organisations", "Edoardo Bovio", "Tel.: +39 0187 527321", "Fax: +39 0187 527700", "Research Organisations", "Massimo Caccia", "Tel.: +39 010 6475612", "Fax: +39 010 6475600", "Research Organisations", "Ricardo Serr\u00e3o Santos", "Tel.: +351292207800", "Fax: +351292207811", "Higher or Secondary Education Establishments", "TERESA MALHOA", "Tel.: +351 21 8417000", "Fax: +351 21 8499242", "Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments)", "Stefan K\u00f6nnecke", "Tel.: +49 421 457 1175"], "From": ["2012-02-01"], "Project_ID": ["288704"], "Call_for_Proposal": ["FP7-ICT-2011-7"]},

Current analytical technology is too expensive and bound to the laboratory to test more than a small fraction of 1% of the EU's food. This problem requires more massive screening of food and water extending from the source to the point of consumption. A low-cost and portable system delivering analytical data to a central location would help to prevent or identify early any food safety threat outbreaks and thereby massively reduce human suffering and its associated financial cost on both sides of the global divide. FOODSNIFFER is field-deployable and simple-to-use as a result of the integration of three major innovations: (i) the transducer itself, an all-silicon fully integrated optoelectronic platform based on Broad-Band Mach-Zehnder Interferometry capable of synchronous highly-sensitive label-free multi-analyte detection. This ultimately-integrated transducer due to the incorporation of the light-sources, sensing elements, spectral analyzer and photodetectors, in a single chip, can be used in single-shot cartridges. (ii) the innovative design of the wafer-scale microfluidics and filtration systems that unburden the reader of external pumps/valves, and intensive sample preparation. (iii) the development of a low-power reader controlled by a smartphone through a custom-produced application. The software controls the sensor and also processes its signal and then sends the results securely via the internet during the on-the-spot food safety analysis. FOODSNIFFER is a complete business solution which will be demonstrated in three areas of great importance to European society and regulators, viz. the detection of pesticide residues, mycotoxins and allergens in selected food categories in order to demonstrate field-based detection of harmful species at low concentrations, which is a feat unattained so far by any point-of-need system.", "To": ["2016-02-29, closed project"], "Meta": ["<meta name=\"WT.cg_s\" content=\"FP7-ICT\">"], "Topic_s": ["ICT-2011.3.2 - Smart components and smart systems integration"], "Funding_scheme": ["CP - Collaborative project (generic)"], "Coordinated_in": ["Greece"], "Activity": ["Research Organisations", "EURIPIDES PAPADOPOULOS", "Tel.: +30 210 6503037", "Fax: +30 210 6522623", "Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments)", "Isabella Moser", "Tel.: +497615577520", "Fax: +497615577522", "Higher or Secondary Education Establishments", "Antonio Miguel Posadas Chinchilla", "Tel.: +34950214669", "Research Organisations", "Maija \u00c4rling", "Tel.: +358401702907", "Research Organisations", "Mirka Laasonen", "Tel.: +358 40 4847459", "Fax: +358 20 7227012", "Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments)", "MICHELE LEES", "Tel.: +33251832107", "Fax: +33251832111", "Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments)", "Aikaterini Karapataki", "Tel.: +302105319382", "Fax: +302105319382", "Other", "Eric Smith", "Tel.: +31 31772 8888", "Private for-profit entities (excluding Higher or Secondary Education Establishments)", "Arne Leinse", "Tel.: +31532030053", "Fax: +31532011303", "Research Organisations", "Jelte Zeilstra", "Tel.: +31317480258", "Fax: +31317417717", "Higher or Secondary Education Establishments", "Andrzej Budkowski", "Tel.: +48 12 663 5550", "Fax: +48 12 633 7086"], "From": ["2012-09-01"], "Project_ID": ["318319"], "Call_for_Proposal": ["FP7-ICT-2011-8"]},

Plants have evolved very robust growth behaviours to respond to changes in their environment and a network of highly sensorized branching roots to efficiently explore the soil volume, mining minerals and up-taking water. PLANTOID has two major goals: 1) to abstract and synthesize with robotic artefacts the principles that enable plant roots to effectively and efficiently explore and adapt to underground environments; 2) to formulate scientifically testable hypotheses and models of some unknown aspects of plant roots, such as the role of local communication among root apices during adaptive growth and the combination of rich sensory information to produce collective decisions. The PLANTOID artefact will be composed of a network of sensorized and actuated roots, displaying rich sensing and coordination capabilities as well as energy-efficient actuation and high sustainability, typical of the Plant Kingdom. Each PLANTOID root will consist of an apex that comprises sensors, actuators, control units, and by an elongation zone that mechanically connects the apex and the trunk of the robot. The new technologies expected to result from PLANTOID concern energy-efficient actuation systems, chemical and physical micro-sensors, sensor fusion techniques, kinematics models, and distributed, adaptive control in networked structures with local information and communication capabilities.
